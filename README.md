```

This Project uses the default camera on the device to capture video feed and process further information.

Accuracy of the program depends heavily on the quality of the camera.

In low light conditions, fps of any camera takes a hit and drops down to 12-15fps, use in a well lit environment for 30fps smoothness.

## Gestures:
    -   Mouse control: Index finger tip
    -   Left click: thumb tip touching pinky finger tip
    -   Right click: thumb tip touching ring finger tip
    -   Audio controls: all fingers closed except thumb, imagine a thumbs-up gesture but sideways (palm towards camera), pull up for   audio up, pull down for audio down.


> _Note_: The speech recognition feature is under development.
